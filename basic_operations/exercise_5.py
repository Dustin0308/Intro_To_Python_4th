# Will an error occur if you try to access a list element with an index greater than or equal to 
# the list's length? For example:

foo = ['a', 'b', 'c']
print(foo[3])      # will this result in an error?




# My Answer:

# Yes it will. It will give an IndexError because the list index is out of range. 




# Launch School's Answer:

# Yes, an error will occur: list index out of range. When you use an index value with no 
# corresponding element, Python raises an IndexError error.
