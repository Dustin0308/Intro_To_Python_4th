# To what value does the following expression evaluate?

'foo' == 'Foo'




# My Answer: 

# False because Python evaluates from left to right on each operand. It encounters 'f' and compares
# it to 'F' and they are not equal (case matters).It stops there and evaluates to False. 



# Launch School's Answer:

# It evaluates as False since the case matters when comparing strings.
